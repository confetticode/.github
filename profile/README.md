# Introduction

Welcome to ConfettiCode!

Hi, my name is Quỳnh Nguyễn - a full stack web developer from Vietnam. I'm inspired by lots of projects on GitHub, they are [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony), [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel), [Spatie](https://github.com/spatie), [BeyondCode](https://github.com/beyondcode) and many others. Therefore, I create my own organization **ConfettiCode** (Code as Colorful Confetti)  where I'm free to publish my code. At least, I can code for fun like a hobby. In the future, I might also publish more my samples, ideas or personal projects under **ConfettiCode**.
