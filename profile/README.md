# Introduction

Welcome to ConfettiCode!

Hi, my name is Quá»³nh - a fullstack web developer from Vietnam. I am inspired by lots of open source software projects on GitHub especially Laravel and it's ecosystem. So, I create my own organization where I am free to publish my code. At least, I can code for fun like a hobby. In the future, I might also publish more personal projects or projects under ConfettiCode.
