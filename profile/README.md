# About ConfettiCode

Welcome to ConfettiCode!

Hi, my name is Quynh - a software developer from Vietnam. I am inspired by lots of open source software projects on GitHub. So, I decided to create my own organization where I am free to publish my code. At least, I can code for fun like a hobby. :) It makes me happy while working as a software developer in daily life.

There are available repositories I have already used in my private projects:

- [Laravel Logging](https://github.com/confetticode/laravel-logging)
- [Random Name](https://github.com/confetticode/random-name)
